# MLflow Basics Example

This repository contains a basic example project demonstrating how to incorporate [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/) into a machine learning workflow. It includes tracking experiments, logging metrics and parameters, and saving models using MLflow's powerful autologging and manual logging features.

## 🚀 Features

- Basic setup of MLflow with a machine learning script
- Autologging using `mlflow.autolog()`
- Manual tracking of parameters, metrics, and models
- Visualization output example (`Confusion-matrix.png`)
- Organized project structure for easy reproducibility

## 🧪 How to Use

1. **Install Requirements**

   Make sure you have MLflow installed:

   ```bash
   pip install mlflow
````

2. **Run the Sample Script**

   Run the `test.py` script to start a training run and log metrics:

   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```

3. **Start the MLflow UI**

   To view the logs and artifacts:

   ```bash
   mlflow ui
   ```

   This will start a web interface at `http://localhost:5000`.

## 📊 Output Example

* Logs and artifacts saved in the `mlruns/` directory
* Sample confusion matrix image output (`Confusion-matrix.png`)

## 📚 Files Overview

* **test.py**: Main training script with MLflow logging
* **mlflow-autolog.txt**: Notes about MLflow autologging usage
* **mlflow-basics.txt**: Quick tips or theory related to MLflow
* **src/**: Placeholder for modularized code or future enhancements
